# Project-Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post
## Airbnb - Seattle WA. Pricing Model

This project aims to write a Data Science Blog. I used the datasets from Udacity online course. The dataset provides Airbnb's listings information in Seattle.

### Quick start
- Download the latest release
- Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/zhangshen20/Project-Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post.git
- Install 'Anaconda3' via https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- After installation, open 'Anaconda.Navigator'
- Then, launch 'jupyter notebook'. Once launched, go to a web browser and enter address http://localhost:8888/
- In jupyter, open the downloaded file 'Project_NoteBook.ipynb'

### Project Motivation
This is the starting point of becoming a data scientist. It's interesting to learn how begin as a data scientist. The material is provided by udacity.

The project aims to predict renting prices of properties listed on Airbnb in Seattle WA. 

### File Description
- Jupyter notebook 'Project_NoteBook.ipynb' includes the questiones identified from the data in 'Data' folder and the approaches to 
  - analyse data
  - identify impacting aspects, and 
  - create pricing model based on relevant aspects

- 'data' folder
  - 'listings.csv': listings information of properties - location, property type, size, amenities.
  - 'calendar.csv': available dates of properties for listing - avaiable dates for listing
  - 'reviews.csv': tenant reviews

### Result 

The main findings of the code can be found at the notebook 'Project_NoteBook.ipynb'. 

Going forward, more data and more time on research on listing information are required for building a pricing model.
